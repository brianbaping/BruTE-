BruTE++

This is a follow up for the python based BruTE in C++. No external binaries are used anymore.
Libraries needed to compile: MidiFile, WxWidgets and OpenAL. 
Audio Preview is played via OpenAL like Lotro does, should provide very similar sound to the game.


Current state: 

a bit buggy ( sometimes crashed ) but basically implements the same functionality as BruTE: 
    - Midi loading, ABC exporting
    - editing a text window for the arrangement
    - Band View for graphical arrangement
    - ...
    
Still to come (hopefully): Humanization, easier Drum Sample handling
